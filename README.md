# Odin landing page

The odin landing page is project meant to help people practice their basic html and css skills.

## Skills practiced

The main skill practiced here is layout with flexbox.

## Usage

Not that very useful, maybe someone can just look at the code and learn something new.

## Contributing
I don't think pull request will be useful as the project is just for practice purposes. Feedbacks about the code would be appreciated, however, I mainly long for feedbacks about my commit messages, the meaningfulness of my README file or anything that will make me end up as a good team member in the future rather that a guy good at coding but with this type of commit messages
